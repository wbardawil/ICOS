## Week 1 (Jan 6-10)

### Day 1 (Mon) - SaaS Growth x The Contrarian
**Topic:** Why Most SaaS Founders Fail at Pricing

Most SaaS founders undercharge.

They think low prices = more customers.
Wrong. Low prices = low-quality customers.

Here's the truth:
→ Cheap customers churn fastest.
→ Cheap customers demand the most support.
→ Cheap customers never refer others.

I raised my prices by 3x.
Lost 40% of customers.
Revenue went up 80%.

The lesson?
Price is a filter.
Use it wisely.

### Day 2 (Tue) - Solopreneurship x The Actionable
**Topic:** How to Build a $10k/month Business in 90 Days

Here's my exact system:

**Step 1: Pick ONE skill.**
Not three. Not "I do marketing AND design AND copywriting."
One.

**Step 2: Find 10 people with that problem.**
DM them. Ask questions. Listen.

**Step 3: Solve it for free.**
Build case studies. Collect testimonials.

**Step 4: Productize.**
Turn your process into a repeatable offer.

**Step 5: Charge.**
Start at $1k. Raise every 3 clients.

I did this in 2024.
Went from $0 to $12k/month in 87 days.

The system works.
Will you?

### Day 3 (Wed) - No-Code Systems x The Analytical
**Topic:** First Principles of No-Code Automation

Every automation has 3 parts:

1. **Trigger** → What starts it?
2. **Logic** → What decisions does it make?
3. **Action** → What does it do?

That's it.

Zapier, Make, n8n — they all follow this.

Stop thinking in tools.
Start thinking in systems.

Once you see the pattern, you can build anything.

### Day 4 (Thu) - Remote Leadership x The Observation
**Topic:** I Watched 50 Remote Teams Fail

I analyzed 50 remote startups over 2 years.

The pattern was clear:
→ Teams with daily standups: 30% higher churn.
→ Teams with async updates: 2x faster shipping.

The surveillance managers failed.
The trust-based managers won.

Remote work isn't about "managing time."
It's about managing outcomes.

If you're still counting hours, you've already lost.

---

### Day 5 (Fri) - Personal Branding x The Motivational
**Topic:** You're Not "Too Late" to Build a Brand

I started at 35.
Zero followers. Zero credibility.

People told me:
"The market is saturated."
"Nobody cares what you think."
"You missed the wave."

18 months later:
→ 50k followers.
→ $200k in revenue.
→ A business I control.

The best time to start was 5 years ago.
The second best time? Right now.

Stop waiting for permission.
Start building.

## Week 2 (Jan 13-17)

### Day 6 (Mon) - SaaS Growth x X vs Y
**Topic:** Old Growth vs New Growth

**Old Way:**
→ Raise $5M.
→ Hire 20 people.
→ Burn cash on ads.
→ Pray for product-market fit.

**New Way:**
→ Bootstrap with $0.
→ Stay solo or small.
→ Build in public.
→ Let customers find you.

The old way builds companies.
The new way builds wealth.

Choose wisely.

---

### Day 7 (Tue) - Solopreneurship x The Observation
**Topic:** I Studied 100 Successful Solopreneurs

I analyzed 100 one-person businesses making $500k+.

The common thread?
Not talent. Not luck. Not connections.

**Systems.**

Every single one had:
→ A repeatable offer.
→ A content engine.
→ An automated delivery.

They don't work harder.
They work smarter.

Build the system. Then let it run.

---

### Day 8 (Wed) - No-Code Systems x The Motivational
**Topic:** You Don't Need to Code to Build a Tech Company

I can't write a single line of Python.

But I've built:
→ 3 SaaS products.
→ 2 automation agencies.
→ 1 AI-powered tool.

All with no-code.

The gatekeepers are gone.
The tools are free.
The tutorials are everywhere.

The only thing stopping you?
The story you tell yourself.

Start building.

---

### Day 9 (Thu) - Remote Leadership x X vs Y
**Topic:** Micromanagement vs Macro-Leadership

**Micromanagers:**
→ Check Slack status every hour.
→ Require cameras on.
→ Schedule daily check-ins.
→ Measure inputs.

**Macro-Leaders:**
→ Set clear outcomes.
→ Trust the process.
→ Check in weekly.
→ Measure results.

One creates anxiety.
One creates autonomy.

Which leader are you?

---

### Day 10 (Fri) - Personal Branding x The Analytical
**Topic:** The Anatomy of a Viral Post

I broke down my top 10 posts.

Every single one had:
1. A hook that challenged a belief.
2. A story with specific numbers.
3. A system anyone could copy.
4. A one-line lesson.

That's the formula.
No magic. Just structure.

Copy it.

## Week 3 (Jan 20-24)

### Day 11 (Mon) - SaaS Growth x The Actionable
**Topic:** 5 Steps to Reduce Churn by 40%

Here's what worked for me:

**Step 1:** Email users who haven't logged in for 7 days.
**Step 2:** Offer a 15-minute onboarding call. Free.
**Step 3:** Build a "quick wins" checklist in the product.
**Step 4:** Send a monthly "value report" showing their ROI.
**Step 5:** Ask for feedback before they cancel.

I did this for 90 days.
Churn dropped from 8% to 4.5%.

The system works.

---

### Day 12 (Tue) - Solopreneurship x The Contrarian
**Topic:** The "Passive Income" Lie

Everyone wants passive income.
Almost no one builds it.

Here's why:
→ "Passive" requires years of active work first.
→ "Passive" still needs maintenance.
→ "Passive" is a marketing term, not a business model.

The truth?
Build a leveraged business.
One where your input doesn't scale linearly with output.

That's not passive.
That's smart.

---

### Day 13 (Wed) - No-Code Systems x The Contrarian
**Topic:** Why Most No-Code Projects Fail

It's not the tools.
It's the thinking.

Most people:
→ Start with the tool.
→ Build features without a plan.
→ End up with spaghetti workflows.

Smart builders:
→ Start with the outcome.
→ Map the system on paper first.
→ Then pick the tool.

Tools don't build businesses.
Systems do.

---

### Day 14 (Thu) - Remote Leadership x The Actionable
**Topic:** How to Run Async Standups That Actually Work

Here's my system:

**Step 1:** Create a Slack channel called #async-updates.
**Step 2:** Every morning, each person posts:
- What I did yesterday.
- What I'm doing today.
- Any blockers.
**Step 3:** Leaders respond only to blockers.
**Step 4:** No meetings unless there's a blocker.

Result?
→ 3 hours/week saved per person.
→ Higher focus.
→ Better documentation.

Try it for 2 weeks.

---

### Day 15 (Fri) - Personal Branding x X vs Y
**Topic:** Creator vs Influencer

**Influencers:**
→ Chase followers.
→ Sell ads.
→ Depend on algorithms.
→ Build on rented land.

**Creators:**
→ Build an audience.
→ Sell products.
→ Own the relationship.
→ Build on owned land.

One is a job.
One is a business.

Choose creator.

---

## Week 4 (Jan 27-31)

### Day 16 (Mon) - SaaS Growth x The Observation
**Topic:** I Watched 20 SaaS Launches This Year

Patterns I noticed:

**Winners:**
→ Launched with a waitlist.
→ Had 3 launch partners.
→ Focused on ONE channel.

**Losers:**
→ Launched to crickets.
→ Tried to be everywhere.
→ Had no social proof.

Launch is not a moment.
It's a campaign.

Plan it.

---

### Day 17 (Tue) - Solopreneurship x The Motivational
**Topic:** The Compound Effect of Showing Up

Day 1: 0 followers.
Day 30: 100 followers.
Day 90: 500 followers.
Day 180: 2,000 followers.
Day 365: 10,000 followers.

People see the 10k.
They don't see the 365 days.

Consistency is boring.
But boring works.

Show up again tomorrow.

---

### Day 18 (Wed) - No-Code Systems x X vs Y
**Topic:** Manual vs Automated

**Manual:**
→ Copy-paste data between apps.
→ Send emails one by one.
→ Check dashboards every hour.
→ Work IN the business.

**Automated:**
→ Data flows automatically.
→ Emails send themselves.
→ Dashboards update in real-time.
→ Work ON the business.

Every manual task is a system waiting to be built.

Build it.

---

### Day 19 (Thu) - Remote Leadership x The Motivational
**Topic:** Trust is the Ultimate Productivity Hack

I used to micromanage.
Check-ins. Status updates. Slack pings.

My team hated it.
I hated it.
And output was mediocre.

Then I tried something radical:
I trusted them.

I set goals. I stepped back.

Productivity doubled.
Turnover dropped to zero.

Control kills speed.
Trust creates it.

---

### Day 20 (Fri) - Personal Branding x The Contrarian
**Topic:** Stop Trying to "Go Viral"

Viral is a lottery ticket.
Consistency is a paycheck.

One viral post gets you followers.
100 consistent posts get you customers.

I've had "viral" moments.
They didn't pay my bills.

The boring, consistent content did.

Stop chasing lightning.
Start building a machine.
