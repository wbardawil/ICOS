# Scaling Through Systems: How to Document As You Grow

## LinkedIn Post

Most founders scale by hiring.
Smart founders scale by documenting.

Here's the difference:

**Hiring without systems:**
→ You become the bottleneck.
→ Every question comes to you.
→ Training takes months. Turnover costs millions.

**Documenting as you grow:**
→ Your knowledge lives outside your head.
→ New hires onboard in days, not months.
→ The business runs without you in the room.

Here's my 3-step documentation system:

**Step 1: Record before you hire.**
Every time you do a task more than twice, record yourself doing it.
Loom. 5 minutes. Done.

**Step 2: Turn videos into SOPs.**
Use AI to transcribe. Edit into bullet points.
One page. No fluff.

**Step 3: Store in one place.**
Notion. Coda. Google Docs.
Doesn't matter. Just pick ONE and stick to it.

I did this before scaling from 3 to 15 people.
Result: Onboarding time dropped from 6 weeks to 5 days.

**The lesson:**
Your systems are your leverage.
Document today. Scale tomorrow.
